# WasteRouteTracker

React Native app for visualizing waste collection routes. Displays pre-geocoded stops on a map with route polylines and collection schedule.

## Features

- Map view with route markers and polylines connecting stops in collection order
- Week navigation strip — browse routes day by day
- Schedule decoding: `xxx4xxx` = Thursday only, `xx3xxx7` = Wednesday + Sunday, etc.
- Frequency display: `1xn` = once a week, `1x2n` = once every 2 weeks
- Multiple routes per day — cycle between them with the route toggle button
- Route statistics: stops, total volume, bins per route

## Tech Stack

- React Native 0.85.3 (New Architecture enabled)

## Data

Route data is stored in `src/assets/data/` — last full week of March 2026 (Mon 2026-03-23 → Sun 2026-03-29):

- 35 routes across 7 days
- ~6,400 stops total
- Addresses in Jelgava, Latvia

Addresses are pre-geocoded via Mapbox Geocoding API and stored in `src/assets/data/geocodingCache.json` (committed to git). The app loads the cache as Redux initial state — no runtime geocoding, no API calls on startup.

## Requirements

- Node >= 22.11.0
- Yarn 3.x
- Ruby + Bundler (iOS)
- Xcode (iOS) / Android Studio (Android)
- React Native environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment

## Setup

This project uses **Yarn** — do not use `npm install`.

```bash
yarn install
```

### iOS

```bash
cd ios && bundle install && cd ..
cd ios && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
yarn ios
```

### Android

```bash
yarn android
```

## Scripts

```bash
yarn start        # start Metro bundler
yarn ios          # run on iOS simulator
yarn android      # run on Android emulator
yarn lint         # ESLint
yarn prettier     # Prettier format
yarn ts-check     # TypeScript check
yarn test         # Jest
```

## E2E Tests (Detox)

Install `applesimutils` once (required by Detox for iOS):

```bash
brew tap wix/brew && brew install applesimutils
```

```bash
yarn e2e:build:ios   # build the app for simulator
yarn e2e:test:ios    # run e2e tests
```

## Geocoding (one-time, already done)

`scripts/geocodeAddresses.js` geocodes all addresses via Mapbox and writes `src/assets/data/geocodingCache.json`. The output is committed to git — other developers do not need to run this script.

To re-run (e.g. after updating route data), add a `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` to `.env` (see `.env.example`) and run:

```bash
node scripts/geocodeAddresses.js
```

## Schedule Code Format

Each stop has a 7-character schedule code where each position represents a day (Mon – Sun):

- digit = service on that day
- `x` = no service

Examples:

- `xxx4xxx` → Thursday only
- `xx3xxx7` → Wednesday + Sunday
- `x2x4xx7` → Tuesday + Thursday + Sunday
- `1234567` → every day

## Frequency Codes

- `1xn` — once a week
- `1x2n` — once every 2 weeks
- `1x3n` — once every 3 weeks
- `1xnn` — once a week (variant)
